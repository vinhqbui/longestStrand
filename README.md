## Usage of ```numpy``` and ```SequenceMatcher```
numpy read binary file really efficient.

This is the problem longest common substring. However, I found that the function ```find_longest_match``` of the ```SequenceMatcher``` is much more efficient than I could write, so I use it to improve efficiently.
